/**
 * There are n projects labeled from 0 to n - 1. Some projects are dependent on other projects. For
 * example, to complete project 0 you have to first finish project 1, which is expressed as a pair:
 * [0, 1]. Also, the project x requires y days to finish, which will present as timeline <x, y>, the
 * projects can be processed in parallel. Now if one plans to use the shortest time to finish all
 * the projects, what is the timeline of all the projects by starting date?
 * <p>
 * input: n = 3, prerequisites = [[1, 0]] timeline[0] = 1 timeline[1] = 2 timeline[2] = 3 output:
 * [2, 0, 1]
 * <p>
 * input: n = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] timeline[0] = 1 timeline[1] = 2 output: []
